# Salary-Analysis-by-Gender

## Introduction
Gender pay gap is a widely discussed topic in various fields. Analyzing salary data by gender can provide insights into the extent of this disparity. In this post, we'll demonstrate how to load the data, clean it, visualize it, and finally, apply linear regression to understand the salary differences between genders.
